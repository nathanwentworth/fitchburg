An exploration and photography game made with a small group of friends in our free time. Featured in [Rock, Paper, Shotgun](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/08/13/best-free-games-of-the-week-28/).

Outerworld Image is a surreal, meditative photography game. Walk around a neon planet, taking photos at your leisure that can be saved and shared, while listening to some calming music and not thinking about the end of the world. Made by 5 students in a semester.

> "You know, to remind you of the good times when you were inside a weird, pink game world, and not in this overwhelming collapsible reality."
